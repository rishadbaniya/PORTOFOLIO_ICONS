Hi there! I am a CS undergraduate student at Kathmandu University, Nepal. I have been actively working in web and mobile development in recent years and completed several projects with Flutter, Firebase, JavaScipt, and MERN stack. I also have a deep interest in Computer Networks and Cloud Computing.
